 GOLDEN_BULL_NAME:1 "Charles IV's Golden Bull"
 GOLDEN_BULL_DESC:1 "The Golden Bull of 1356 was a decree, issued by the Reichstag in Nuremberg headed by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, that fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire for a period of more than four hundred years. It was named the Golden Bull for the golden seal it carried. The same year, the Hanseatic League was founded as an alliance of trading guilds that established and maintained a trade monopoly over most of Northern Europe. England forced Edward Balliol to surrender the crown of Scotland and captured John II of France at the Battle of Poitiers."
 1444_NAME:0 "Rise of the Ottomans"
 1444_DESC:0 "The day after the crushing defeat of the Poles and Hungarians by the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Varna, and the death of King Władysław III of Poland, ending the Crusade of Varna. This left the Albanian armies under the capable general Skanderbeg to fend off the Ottoman armies alone, which they would do for the next 24 years."
 1453_NAME:0 "The Fall of Byzantium"
 1453_DESC:0 "Begins just as Ottoman Emperor Mehmet II completes his conquest of the great city of Constantinople, sweeping away the last vestiges of Imperial Rome. Meanwhile, England and France are preparing for the Battle of Castilion, which will prove to be the last battle in the Hundred Year's War. Also in that same year, in Mainz, Johannes Gutenburg set up his moveable type printing press."
 1492_NAME:0 "A New World!"
 1492_DESC:0 "An ambitious Italian navigator under the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain landed on San Salvador in the Bahamas, originally believing that he had successfully found a westward passage to the East Indies. Earlier that year Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile completed the Reconquista, a nearly eight-hundred year struggle against the Islamic invaders, expelling the last Muslim dynasty from the Iberian peninsula."
 1508_NAME:0 "War of the League of Cambrai"
 1508_DESC:0 "The League of Cambrai was a coalition formed by Pope Julius II, consisting of the Papal States, France, the Holy Roman Empire and Aragon to curb the growing power of Venice. However, midway through the war the sides began to change. Suddenly it was Venice and the Papacy against France and Ferrara. Then Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England and Milan joined with the Papacy, forming the Holy League. Finally Scotland joined in on France's side. This was the beginning of the intricate and internecine Italian Wars, which ravaged the peninsula for more than fifty years. Historically at the end of this phase of the wars, Venice and France came out ahead. The power of the papacy was checked, and would be further challenged by the onset of the Reformation."
 1579_NAME:0 "Eighty Years War"
 1508_DESC:0 "Also known as the Dutch War of Independence, this conflict pits the recently-formed Netherlands under Willam, Prince of Orange and its allies (including England and France) against Habsburg Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. This war, fought between Habsburg-supporting Catholics and Dutch Calvinists, was one of the major wars fought during the Reformation."
 1618_NAME:0 "Thirty Years War"
 1618_DESC:0 "Often considered one of the most destructive wars in history, the Thirty Years' War was both a Protestant-versus-Catholic religious war, as well as a Bourbon-versus-Habsburg war between the great dynasties of Europe. The scenario opens on the Bohemian Revolt, which got off to a spectacular start by throwing a few Catholic representatives of the the Emperor out of a window. Bohemia was taken by Protestants, and the zealous Catholic King Ferdinand was sent packing. The Protestant Elector of the Palatinate, Frederick V was installed as the new monarch. The revolution seemed to have succeeded marvelously."
 1701_NAME:0 "War of the Spanish Succession"
 1701_DESC:0 "Upon the death of Charles II, war broke out over who would reign over Spain's vast European and colonial empire. It pitted Catholic France and Spain, plus at the beginning Bavaria against the Holy Roman Empire, England, which during the course of the war, would reform itself as Great Britain, Netherlands, Savoy and Portugal. In colonial North America, this conflict became known as Queen Anne's War."
 1718_NAME:0 "War of the Quadruple Alliance"
 1718_DESC:0 "Philip V's reign was not to be a peaceable one after he reneged on his agreement to give up his ambitions for the French crown and invaded Sardinia, talking it away from the Holy Roman Empire. His ambition inevitably led to a coalition that formed to oppose him after the uncovering of the Cellamare Conspiracy, a plot to make Philip the Regent of France. In response, the Quadruple Alliance formed, consisting of France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Empire. Later they were joined by Savoy. The war was unique in that it was the only time during the century that the rivals France and England were allied."
 1756_NAME:0 "Seven Years' War"
 1756_DESC:0 "With the decline of Spain, Great Britain and France emerged as the two main global colonial powers. And with the decline of the Holy Roman Empire, Prussia emerged under Frederick the Great of the house of Hohenzollern as the powerhouse of central Europe. The war opens on the isle of Minorca in the Balleares, where a small British force was under siege. After the disastrous naval loss for the relieving British squadron, war would engulf five continents."
 1776_NAME:0 "American War of Independence"
 1776_DESC:0 "Great Britain had won the Seven Years' War, but at what price? The taxes levied to pay off the war debts rankled the colonies of North America. This boiled over into the American Revolution. Though the conflict began de facto in 1775 at Lexington and Concord, on July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence, formally declaring: That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown. Yet victory in the war was far from certain. General George Washington, though swept out of New York and New Jersey by the British Army in the following months, would, by Christmas, make a surprise Crossing of the Delaware and gain victory at the Battle of Trenton. This turning point proved that the Colonials were a force that even the greatest empire on the Earth needed to give due respect."
 1789_NAME:0 "The French Revolution"
 1789_DESC:0 "The Seven Years' War and American Revolutions, as draining as they were to British coffers, were also costly for the ancien régime of France. Their participation in the American Revolution alone, for instance, had cost over one billion livres, all paid for by high-interest loans. Though Louis XVI had attempted Enlightenment-era reforms, such as the abolition of serfdom and tolerance towards non-Catholics, in the end it seemed that every reform he offered just fueled the popular desire for more. On July 14, 1789, these increasing resentments boiled over and the Bastille was stormed."
 1792_NAME:0 "Revolutionary France"
 1792_DESC:0 "During the French Revolution, the proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy was a proclamation by the National Convention of France announcing that it had abolished the French monarchy on 21 September 1792. Fearing that the revolutionary fervor would spread to their countries, other European monarchs called for war against the new revolutionary government."
